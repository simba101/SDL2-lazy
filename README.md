# SDL2 lazyfoo' tutorial files

This repository holds the files created while learning to use the SDL2 based on
the course provided by lazyfoo' [https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php]().

### Compiling and running
First make sure that you have the necessary build tools as well as SDL2
developer libraries installed. For \*buntu systems, you will need:
 * libsdl2-dev
 * libsdl2-image-dev
 * libsdl2-ttf-dev
 * libsdl2-mixer-dev

If you'd like to compile the examples on another linux distro, check its manual
for instructions on how to install the SDL2 development libraries.

Once they are installed correctly, simply use the provided makefiles to build
and run the example codes.

### License and copyright notice
All of the files present in the repository - including the graphics
and makefiles have been created by **simba** (szczerbiakadam@gmail.com).
I have re-created the programs from the tutorial created by lazyfoo'
[https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php]() by rewriting the code
from scratch in my own way, refining it where applicable.
